Title: A user-friendly tool for inferring tree-shaped 
  trajectories from single-cell data
Version: 0.99.0
Description: Totem is a tool designed to facilitate the inference of 
  tree-shaped trajectories from single-cell RNA-seq data. The key idea is 
  to generate 
  a large number of clustering results, rank them, and examine the resulting 
  top-ranked clustering results. The probability of finding an optimal clustering 
  increases when different clusterings are considered. Totem uses the 
  Slingshot method to smoothen the lineages of the trajectory network.
  In addition, the cell connectivity measure derived from the cluster 
  connectivity of Minimum Spanning Trees (MSTs) of the clustering results 
  can be used to aid the trajectory optimization.
